A .NET port of [Ion to Image, i2i](https://github.com/LanekoffLab/i2i). It is currently a work in progress. The goal is to convert the original application from requiring a MATLAB-license to run.

# What is i2i?
i2i is an application for processing of mass spectrometry imaging data sets. Read more about it from the MATLAB implementation repository here: https://github.com/LanekoffLab/i2i, as well as the original article [here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c01615) and my [recent developments](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.07.642022v1).
